# Library for chess rules

This library is currently under development and primarily a hobby project.

The main motivation is to have the rules implemented in an understandable way. Therefore the project has a very high test coverage to ensure, the rules are enforced as expected. Due to the OOP style of the implementation the performance is much worse than those highly optimized implementations. One benefit of this approach is, that it will be relatively easy to (optionally) modify the rules, which very likely is not a desired feature for most players, but may create some interesting new ways of playing this game.
